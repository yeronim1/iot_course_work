# Course Work: Graph Traversal Using AVL Tree

## Description
This course work implements **Graph** and **AVL Tree** as the data structure. The graph is represented as an **edge list**, it is **undirected** and **unweighted**. The traversal is done using the **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm. 

### Student Details:
- **Name:** Yaroslav Morgun
